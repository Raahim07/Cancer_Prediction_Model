# Cancer Prediction Model with Flask Deployment
Predicting cancer is crucial for timely diagnosis and treatment. This project leverages Logistic Regression to predict cancer based on provided data. Additionally, it facilitates model deployment using Flask.


## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a cancer prediction model. Here's what's included:

- **Logistic Regression Model**: Implementation of a predictive model using logistic regression.
- **Flask Deployment**: Scripts and configurations for deploying the model using Flask.
- **Data**: Sample datasets used for training and testing the model.
- **Documentation**: Instructions and guides for using and contributing to the project.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.11.1
- Flask
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

   git clone https://github.com/Raahim/YourRepository.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Repository**:

   ```bash
   cd YourRepository
   ```

3. **Train the Model**:

   Train the logistic regression model using your dataset.

4. **Create Pickle File**:

   Use the provided scripts to serialize the trained model into a pickle file.

5. **Deploy Model with Flask**:

   Run the Flask server to deploy the model.
